Assignment Objectives: 

> Write a program that performs as a very simple calculator. 

> Your calculator should be able to handle the five basic math operations 
	add, 
	subtract
	multiply
	divide
	modulus (remainder) - on two input values. 
	
> Your program should prompt the user to enter three arguments: 
	* two single digit integer values 
	* a character to represent an operation (*, /, +, -, %). 

>If the entry arguments are 3, 7, and '+', the program output should be 
	"The sum of 3 and 7 is 10." 

>Make the program only accept single-digit numbers written as 
either digits or spelled out.
